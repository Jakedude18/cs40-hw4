    We referenced previous homeworks iii and locality for UArray2b, UArray2,
    and A2Methods implementations. Additionally, we referenced locality's 
    main method.

Files:
40image.c
    Holds the main method and calls compress and decompress to execute steps
    of compression and decompression.
compressor.c
    Holds aggregator function compress that calls the steps of compression
compressor.h
    Header file to compressor.c
decompressor.c
    Holds the aggregator function decompress that calls the steps of
    decompression
decompressor.h
    Header file to decompressor.c
CVFConvertor.c
    Converts a block of rgbs to component video values or can inverse this
    conversion
CVFConvertor.h
    Header file to CVFConvertor.c
DCTConvertor.c
    Converts component video values to discrete cosine values or can
    inverse this conversion
DCTConvertor.h
    Header file to DCTConvertor.c
quantize.c
    Quantizes discrete cosine values and quantizes PB and PR chroma values
    or can dequantize discrete cosine values and quantizes PB and PR chroma
    values
quantize.h
    Header file to quantize.c
WordFields.h
    Declares the WordFields struct
bitpacker.c
    Bitpacks quantized values into an integer or can unpack an integer into
    quantized values
quantize.h
    Header file to bitpacker.c
bitpack.c
    Defines to functions for the bitpack interface
bitpack.h
    Header file to bitpack.c
Makefile
    compiles our code and creates a 40image executable binary.
    Additionally, it creates a bitpack.o relocatable object file.

Identifies what has been correctly implemented and what has not
    We have implemented all aspects
